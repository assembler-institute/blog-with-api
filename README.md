> In this pill we have learned how to create a blog with an API serving the necessary data to create it.

* HTML: skeleton of the project
* CSS: styles of our page
* Bootstrap and SASS: as css framework
* JS Vanilla: project logic
* PokeAPI and JSON Server: get data and send data to create our own API.
