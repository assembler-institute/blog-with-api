## How to run it

To run it you need to have Json Server installed beforehand, for more info [Json Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).
To start JSON server you need yo run in console from the root of the project
```
json-server --watch ./data/db.json
```
An alternative is to modify the main.js second line to 
```
const baseURL = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/`;
```
With this last aproach you cannot edit or delete posts!
